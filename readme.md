# CamCore Infrastructure Monitor downstream

This repository is CamCore's maintained downstream of
[Beszel](https://github.com/henrygd/beszel) for private, administrator-focused
infrastructure monitoring across **CamCore — Cameron Family Secure Network**.

> **CamCore is a privately owned and operated family technology network that
> delivers secure, reliable and professionally managed digital services for the
> Cameron household, Cameron-Media and associated family operations.**

**Built for Home. Engineered Like Enterprise.**

## CamCore scope

- The downstream applies the **CamCore Infrastructure Monitor** browser, login,
  logo and PWA identity while retaining Beszel's upstream monitoring
  functionality.
- The CamCore workflow can publish `ghcr.io/camcoreau/beszel:latest` and a
  traceable `sha-*` image tag when the maintained interface or image definition
  changes.
- Monitoring is intended for CamCore administrators. This public repository
  must never contain credentials, access tokens, private keys or monitoring
  data.
- Repository and image availability do not prove that a particular image is
  deployed or that any live service is healthy. No deployment hostname or host
  topology is defined by the current default branch.

For controlled testing and rollback, prefer the published `sha-*` tag over the
mutable `latest` tag and record the deployed image digest.

Beszel and its original documentation remain the work of
[Henry Goddard](https://github.com/henrygd) and upstream contributors. CamCore
does not claim authorship of the upstream application. The downstream preserves
the upstream [MIT Licence](LICENSE).

## Features

- **Lightweight**: Smaller and less resource-intensive than leading solutions.
- **Simple**: Easy setup with little manual configuration required.
- **Docker stats**: Tracks CPU, memory, and network usage history for each container.
- **Alerts**: Configurable alerts for CPU, memory, disk, bandwidth, temperature, load average, and status.
- **Multi-user**: Users manage their own systems. Admins can share systems across users.
- **OAuth / OIDC**: Supports many OAuth2 providers. Password auth can be disabled.
- **Automatic backups**: Save to and restore from disk or S3-compatible storage.
<!-- - **REST API**: Use or update your data in your own scripts and applications. -->

## Architecture

Beszel consists of two main components: the **hub** and the **agent**.

- **Hub**: A web application built on [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) that provides a dashboard for viewing and managing connected systems.
- **Agent**: Runs on each system you want to monitor and communicates system metrics to the hub.

## Getting started

The [quick start guide](https://beszel.dev/guide/getting-started) and other documentation is available on our website, [beszel.dev](https://beszel.dev). You'll be up and running in a few minutes.
